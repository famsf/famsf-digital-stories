        <p>What is this &ldquo;new and revolutionary art?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Before his success, before there was even the term “Impressionism,” Claude Monet labored to define his style and promote himself as an artist. Explore the first 14 years of Monet’s career, when he struggled to provide food and shelter for himself and his family while creating innovations that would turn the art world upside down. Monet: The Early Years begins in 1858 with the first painting Monet showed publicly and closes in 1872, just before he exhibited that year with the group of artists who would come to be known as the Impressionists.</p>

        <h3>Salon Engraving from 1865</h3>
        <p>The Salon was the official, juried art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the dominant arts institution in France. Before the rise of private art dealers, exhibiting at the Salon was the best way for artists to gain recognition and make sales. Both the public—around 300,000 people annually—and the critics flocked to the Salons. For the artists, who competed furiously for the right to exhibit, success at the Salon could lead to fame, wealth, social standing, and influence. Buyers liked pictures presenting pretty nudes, sentimental stories, religious subjects, heroic deeds, patriotic scenes, and touching tales.</p>
        <!-- deep dive here -->
        <p>As a result of industrial expansion, a newly prosperous middle class was replacing the state, the church, and the nobility as primary sources of income for artists. The middle class relied heavily on reviews they read in the press, and they wanted to purchase works that had an official stamp of approval.  This increased the importance for artists to have their work be shown and well reviewed in the Salons. </p>

        <h2>William-Adolphe Bouguereau, The Broken Pitcher, 1891</h2>
        <p>This work by William-Adolphe Bouguereau in the Legion of Honor’s collection exemplifies the style of painting championed by the Salon. Careful to hide all traces of brushwork, Bouguereau painted a convincing illusion of space. Behind the girl’s shoulder, farmland stretches as far as the eye can see. Bouguereau created a realistic sense of depth within this theatrical and moralizing scene; Salon audiences would have understood that the broken pitcher represents the girl’s lost virtue. </p>

        <h2>Monet’s Experience with the Salon</h2>
        <p>Painting was a career, and as in any other, Monet had to figure out the rules to succeed. He knew that acceptance to the Salon was the most assured road to success. Monet actively solicited advice from fellow painters on how to make his paintings acceptable, yet it was difficult to know what would please the Salon jurors.</p>
        <p>Below are several paintings he submitted for exhibition to the Salon. <em><strong>Guess which one was accepted.</strong></em></p>

        <h3>The Pavé de Chailly in the Forest of Fontainebleau, 1865</h3>
        <p>In 1863, the 23-year-old Monet traveled to the majestic forest of Fontainebleau. What was once the private reserve of the kings had become a tourist destination a short railway trip from Paris. He returned the following year and wrote, “The forest is delicious; I should have been here long ago. . . . Everything is superb here.” In Fontainebleau, Monet endeavored to paint entirely out of doors to capture nature directly. This was facilitated by the recent innovation of paint in tubes and portable easels. During this time, Monet also began his practice of returning to a site again and again to experiment with many different ways of registering light under various atmospheric conditions.

      <h3>Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Banks of the Somme at Picquigny, ca. 1865–1870</h3>
      <p>Monet was influenced by a slightly older generation of landscape painters. The painters of the so-called Barbizon School (named after a village in Fontainebleau) were interested in capturing direct, unadorned observations of nature, which challenged popular ideas among the academic art institutions of landscapes as idealized settings. Rather than presenting nature as pristine, balanced, and imbued with noble values, Barbizon School painters such as Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot desired to capture nature’s rough textures with spontaneity and vitality.</p>

      <h3>Gustave Le Gray, The Pavé de Chailly, 1852</h3>
      <p>In Fontainebleau, painters and photographers often worked side by side. The relatively new art form of photography freed artists like Monet from the responsibility of making pure visual records and allowed them to move in the direction of capturing immediate sensations and experimenting with form and color. This artistic tendency would eventually lead to modern art styles that dispensed altogether with recreating the physical world.</p>

      <p>Since Fontainebleau was originally a royal preserve, its trees were able to reach majestic heights seldom seen in other landscapes. One such tree that Monet painted several times was this massive oak.</p>

    <h2>Ambition and Risk</h2>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="l-column">

        <h3>Luncheon on the Grass, 1865–1866</h3>
        <p>In 1865, Monet began an ambitious painting to be submitted to the Salon. Monet knew that scale was important to attract attention at the Salon, and this canvas was more than 13 x 10 feet. Although the work was too large to paint out of doors, he painted many preparatory sketches outside in nature, creating a bravado demonstration of his landscape achievements from Fontainebleau. He populated the picnic scene with life-size figures in modern dress; his friends, acquaintances, and future wife Camille Doncieux posed. Monet wrote that year, “I can think of nothing but my painting, and if I had to leave it, I think I would go mad.” Unfortunately, Monet was too ambitious, and he was unable to complete the canvas in time to submit for the Salon. Economics, always an issue during Monet’s early years, played a role: needing to pay his rent, Monet gave the canvas to his landlord as security. The landlord kept the painting in a damp basement, where parts of the canvas mildewed. When Monet retrieved the painting in 1884, he had to cut away the destroyed parts. These two fragments remain. </p>

        <h3>Antoine Watteau, The Halt During the Chase, 1718–1720</h3>
        <p>Monet was inspired not only by the Barbizon school, but also by French art of the previous century, which he cleverly referenced in his work. By proving to Salon jurors and fellow artists his deep working knowledge of art historical precedents, he hoped to elevate his profile as an artist. He admired the 18th-century paintings of Antoine Watteau, who was well known for his scenes of elegantly dressed people playing music, flirting, or picnicking in idyllic outdoor settings. Monet restaged this elite activity with contemporary middle-class tourists from the city.</p>

        <!-- image: Édouard Manet, Luncheon on the Grass -->
        <h3>Édouard Manet, Luncheon on the Grass, 1863</h3>
        <p>Monet also intended his painting as a tribute and a challenge to fellow painter Édouard Manet, a pivotal figure in art’s transition from realism, a style that emerged in the 1850s, to Impressionism. Manet’s Luncheon on the Grass had been rejected by the Salon in 1863; jurors were shocked by the presence of a nude woman among clothed men (in modern attire) who did not serve any mythological or allegorical purpose. The painting was displayed instead that year at the Salon des Refusés, an exhibition initiated by Napoleon III to show works that had been rejected by the Salon. There it became the principal attraction, generating both laughter and scandal.</p>

    <h2>Paris: Modernity and Leisure</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="l-1up">
        <h3>Charles-Henri Plaut, Le Pont-Neuf and Île de la Cité, 1865–1870</h3>
        <p>Between 1853 and 1870, Paris was in the midst of a vast urban redesign, commissioned by Napoleon III and executed by Baron Haussmann, that included the demolition of overcrowded neighborhoods dating to medieval times. The construction of wide avenues, parks and squares, and new apartment buildings transformed Paris into a modern city.</p>

        <h3>Quai de Louvre, 1867</h3>
        <p>Monet was fascinated by the manifestations of modern urban life on view throughout Paris. He requested, from the French superintendent of the arts, special access to an exterior colonnade of the museum building to paint views of the center of Paris. There the young artist quite literally turned his back to the great repository of art on display in the Louvre. His vantage point provided a platform from which to paint the present and move art toward modernity. Monet visited the Louvre to see the collection of masterworks hanging in the galleries, but unlike other artists in his circle, he did not paint or draw from them.</p>

        <h3>La Grenouillère, 1869</h3>
        <p>Seeking refuge from the intensity of city living, the new middle class traveled to leisure locations easily accessible by train. One such popular destination was a bathing spot on the banks of the Seine, called La Grenouillère (literally “frog pond”).</p>

        <!-- split the following text with croppings of the painting La Grenouillère -->
        <p>Monet became interested in conveying the immediate sensation of being in the places he painted. In La Grenouillère, the artist carefully captured through color and brushstrokes the effects of light, rendering a composition infused with a sense of pleasure. Viewers can witness multiple activities enjoyed by the figures: sitting leisurely at the café, conversing under the central tree, partaking in a swim, and preparing for a boat ride out on the sun-drenched water. Yet for some observers, the true subject of this painting is the water itself. While the activity of the figures is evoked through quick, energetic dashes of the brush, Monet lavished attention on the water, its multiple colors, its reflections, and its depths. </p>
