        <p>What is this &ldquo;new and revolutionary art?&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Before his success, before there was even the term “Impressionism,” Claude Monet labored to define his style and promote himself as an artist. Explore the first 14 years of Monet’s career, when he struggled to provide food and shelter for himself and his family while creating innovations that would turn the art world upside down. Monet: The Early Years begins in 1858 with the first painting Monet showed publicly and closes in 1872, just before he exhibited that year with the group of artists who would come to be known as the Impressionists.</p>

        <p>Who was this young man from a small coastal community, trying to establish himself in the Parisian art world in the 1860s? Two forces drove Monet: his will to be a painter and his will to become critically and commercially successful.</p>

      <div class="l-1up">

        <p>The Salon was the official, juried art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in Paris, the dominant arts institution in France. Before the rise of private art dealers, exhibiting at the Salon was the best way for artists to gain recognition and make sales. Both the public—around 300,000 people annually—and the critics flocked to the Salons. For the artists, who competed furiously for the right to exhibit, success at the Salon could lead to fame, wealth, social standing, and influence. Buyers liked pictures presenting pretty nudes, sentimental stories, religious subjects, heroic deeds, patriotic scenes, and touching tales.</p>
        <!-- deep dive here -->
        <p>As a result of industrial expansion, a newly prosperous middle class was replacing the state, the church, and the nobility as primary sources of income for artists. The middle class relied heavily on reviews they read in the press, and they wanted to purchase works that had an official stamp of approval.  This increased the importance for artists to have their work be shown and well reviewed in the Salons. </p>

        <!-- image: William-Adolphe Bouguereau, The Broken Pitcher, 1891 -->
        <h2>William-Adolphe Bouguereau, The Broken Pitcher, 1891</h2>
        <p>This work by William-Adolphe Bouguereau in the Legion of Honor’s collection exemplifies the style of painting championed by the Salon. Careful to hide all traces of brushwork, Bouguereau painted a convincing illusion of space. Behind the girl’s shoulder, farmland stretches as far as the eye can see. Bouguereau created a realistic sense of depth within this theatrical and moralizing scene; Salon audiences would have understood that the broken pitcher represents the girl’s lost virtue. </p>

        <h2>Monet’s Experience with the Salon</h2>
        <p>Painting was a career, and as in any other, Monet had to figure out the rules to succeed. He knew that acceptance to the Salon was the most assured road to success. Monet actively solicited advice from fellow painters on how to make his paintings acceptable, yet it was difficult to know what would please the Salon jurors.</p>
        <p>Below are several paintings he submitted for exhibition to the Salon. <em><strong>Guess which one was accepted.</strong></em></p>
