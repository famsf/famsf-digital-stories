# FAMSF Digital Stories
### Drupal 8 platform for FAMSF digital Stories Exhibition Websites

## General Documentation
* [Development workflow with GIT and Github](/docs/git/git-intro.md)
* [Detailed Mac Setup guide](/docs/mac-setup.md)
* [Release Syncing & Deployment](docs/deployment.md)

## Requirements

* VMWare, or [virtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) >= 5.0
* [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) >= 1.8
* [ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) `brew install ansible`
* [vagrant-hostmanager](https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager) `vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager`
* [vagrant-auto_network](https://github.com/oscar-stack/vagrant-auto_network) `vagrant plugin install vagrant-auto_network`

If you have been running a previous version of Vagrant you may need to do: `vagrant plugin update` to ensure that you can install the plugins.

## Getting Started

### Configure Git to include Pantheon remote 
Note: if you were doing development on this repo before release 1.10, you should start with a fresh clone of the repo and run the following to add Pantheon as a remote:
`git remote add pantheon ssh://codeserver.dev.ee6cdbc4-f439-4270-bbab-8adf8d3ba96c@codeserver.dev.ee6cdbc4-f439-4270-bbab-8adf8d3ba96c.drush.in:2222/~/repository.git`

### Start the VM
1. From inside the project root, run:
 * `composer install`
 * `vagrant up`
1. You will be prompted for the administration password on your host machine. Obey.
1. Access VM via SSH and install Butler for the styleguide and compile sass:
```
    vagrant ssh
    cd /var/www/famsf-digital-stories.local/styleguide
    composer install
    npm install

```

2. While still accessing the VM by ssh, install the site:

  ```
    cd /var/www/famsf-digital-stories.local
    vendor/bin/phing build install migrate
  ```

1. Visit [famsf-digital-stories.local](http://famsf-digital-stories.local) in your browser of choice.

## Using the Development Environment

1. From inside the project root, type `vagrant ssh`
1. Navigate to `/var/www/famsf-digital-stories.local`
1. Build, install, migrate, and test: `vendor/bin/phing build install migrate test`

This is your project directory; run `composer` and `drush` commands from here, and run build tasks with `vendor/bin/phing`. Avoid using git from here, but if you must, make sure you configure your name and email for proper attribution, and [configure your global .gitignore](https://github.com/palantirnet/development_documentation/blob/master/guidelines/git/gitignore.md):

```
git config --global user.email 'me@palantir.net'
git config --global user.name 'My Name'
```

## How do I work on the front-end?

When you first set up the project, you will need to run `composer install` and `npm install` from /styleguide on the VM (`vagrant ssh` and `cd /var/www/famsf-digital-stories.local/styleguide`)

1. `npm run butler` and allow the script to keep running and watching for changes. 
1. Change some styles in the `sass` directory
1. Observe you see the changes reflected in the Drupal theme

Note that this also updates the 'living styleguide' which also resides in this repo. You can view the styleguide after running the above steps at: famsf-digital-stories.local

The Front-end toolchain is set up the Butler:
[Butler documentation] (https://github.com/palantirnet/butler) 

Butler uses the following:
* [Gulp] (http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Spress] (http://spress.yosymfony.com/)
* [Sass] (http://sass-lang.com/)

## How do I Drupal?

### The Drupal root

This project uses [Composer Installers](https://github.com/composer/installers), [DrupalScaffold](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-scaffold), and [the-build](https://github.com/palantirnet/the-build) to assemble our Drupal root in `web`. Dig into `web` to find the both contrib Drupal code (installed by composer) and custom Drupal code (included in the git repository).

### Using drush

You can run `drush` commands from anywhere within the repository, as long as you are ssh'ed into the vagrant.

### Installing and reinstalling Drupal

Run `composer install && vendor/bin/phing build install migrate`

### Updating Drupal Core

* You should update Drupal using composer: `composer update drupal/core --with-dependencies`

### Adding modules

* Download modules with composer: `composer require drupal/bad_judgement:^8.1`
* Enable the module: `drush en bad_judgement`
* Export the config with the module enabled: `drush config-export`
* Commit the changes to `composer.json`, `composer.lock`, and `conf/drupal/config/core.extension.yml`. The module code itself will be excluded by the project's `.gitignore`.

### Patching modules

Sometimes we need to apply patches from the Drupal.org issue queues. These patches should be applied using composer using the [Composer Patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) composer plugin.

### Configuring Drupal

Sometimes it is appropriate to configure specific Drupal variables in Drupal's `settings.php` file. Our `settings.php` file is built from a template found at `conf/drupal/settings.php` during the phing build.

* Add your appropriately named values to `conf/build.default.properties` (like `drupal.my_setting=example`)
* Update `conf/drupal/settings.php` to use your new variable (like `$conf['my_setting'] = '${drupal.my_setting}';`)
* Run `vendor/bin/phing build`
* Test
* If the variable requires different values in different environments, add those to the appropriate properties files (`conf/build.vagrant.properties`, `conf/build.circle.properties`, `conf/build.acquia.properties`). Note that you may reference environment variables with `drupal.my_setting=${env.DRUPAL_MY_SETTING}`.
* Finally, commit your changes.

### configuring the VM for multiple domains

Should you require setting up vhost configuration for multiple domains in the dev environment, such as for use with Domain Access, you can update the extra_hostnames variable in the vagranfile as follows: 

```
extra_hostnames = ['my-extra-domain-one.local','my-extra-domain-two.local']
```

## How do I run tests?

### Behat

Run `vendor/bin/phing test` or `vendor/bin/behat features/installation.feature`.

## Deployment

See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for details on deploying to Pantheon.

## Troubleshooting

If, on browsing to `http://famsf-digital-stories.local`, you get the following error:
> famsf-digital-stories.localâ€™s server DNS address could not be found.

Then `vagrant up` may have failed half way through. When this happens, the `vagrant-hostmanager` plugin does not add the hostname to `/etc/hosts`. Try halting and re-upping the machine: `vagrant halt && vagrant up`. Reload is not sufficient to trigger updating the hosts file.
