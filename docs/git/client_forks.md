# Client Forks

To hand a development repository over to a client, we generally fork to their organization, rather than changing ownership of the repository.

1. Client creates a [GitHub organization](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-account/)
1. Client adds one of us to the GitHub organization
1. We click the "fork" button on the development repository and make sure the fork goes to the client's GitHub organization
